# Hacks

Most of my hacks are available at [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org/camlspotter).

## Caml hacks

My hacks are mainly in [OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org) programming language.
Some of my stable libraries and applications are available at 
[OPAM](http://opam.ocamlpro.com) repostiory.

[OCamlSpotter](https://bitbucket.org/camlspotter/ocamlspot)
: OCaml compiler tool for source code browsing, including definition search and type inspection.

[Meta-conv](https://bitbucket.org/camlspotter/meta_conv)
: Meta conv is a framework over type-conv, which provides an easier way to auto-generate decoder and encoder between OCaml data types and various tree form data such as JSON, XML, Sexp, etc.

[Tiny-json-conv](https://camlspotter:bitbucket19haskell@bitbucket.org/camlspotter/tiny_json_conv)
: Meta conv for JSON

[Planck](https://camlspotter:bitbucket19haskell@bitbucket.org/camlspotter/planck)
: A small monadic parser combinator library. Parser LANguage Combinator Kit A LL(n) parser monadic combinator library in OCaml. It is small but could parse OCaml language perfectly.

[OMake-mode](https://bitbucket.org/camlspotter/omake-mode)
: Emacs mode for OMake -P

[CamlImages](https://bitbucket.org/camlspotter/camlimages)
: OCaml library for manupilating bitmap images

[ORakuda](https://bitbucket.org/camlspotter/orakuda)
: P4 extension for Perl like strings, i.e., `"hello $name"`, `/[a-z]+/`, `` `ls *.ml` ``.

CamlP4 lexer plugin patch
: A small patch to plug lexer modifications into CamlP4. Included in [ORakuda](https://bitbucket.org/camlspotter/orakuda).

[(　ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡°O'PyCaml](https://bitbucket.org/camlspotter/opycaml)
: Yet another OCaml-Python interface. It uses OCaml's structural polymorphism for more type-safety.

OCaml annot patch
: A small compiler patch enables automatic `.annot` and `.cmt*` annoation file creation. Available as one of OPAM compiler variation.

G'Caml
: OCaml compiler extension for non-parametric polymorphism (i.e. overloading)

$'Caml
: OCaml compiler extension for dictionary dispatching (i.e. Haskell like overloading)

CamlCSS
: Server side plug-in infrustructure in OCaml for VALVe source engine games

大駱駝
: Japanese friendly OCaml

## Haskell related

Offside trap
: Extend haskell-indent/haskell-indentation mode for Emacs from per-line basis to block basis.
